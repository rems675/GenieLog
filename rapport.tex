~~~~~~~~~We have developped a library for manipulating very large integers, the number of digits exceeds the capacity of significantly
representation of integers 32 or 64 bits supported by the conventional types.
The project manager is Saksik Remy, I tried to spread the stain, which I thought was just, in the capacity of each function.

~~~~~~~~~We have chosen not to start programming object (about speed) but we've realized in time that it was not good.
After different tests on the use of memory, of very many memory leaks were observed.

~~~~~~~~~So we opt for the production of clean code and rehabilitation following features of the object model.

 \chapter*{Conclusion}  
    \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Conclusion} 

~~~~~~~~~We have accomplished this project with high and low that few know a team d\'{e}vellopement.
We have demonstrated poor organization at the start but we revised it very quickly which allowed us to finish in time.
This was a project that we qualify rewarding working conditions as a team.
